# Description
Ever wanted a cool **EULA compliant** donator perk that would multiply the experience that all online players get when hunting mobs, smelting ores and playing the game? Then you've found what you were looking for.

This plugin boosts regular Minecraft experience, SkillAPI experience, mcMMO experience and Jobs experience! Do you have a specific plugin request? Feel free to suggest this, and it might be added in the near future!

# Features
* **Supporting many plugins** - You can enable / disable every type of booster.
* **Extreme customizability** - Any message, bossbar, hologram, gui can be modified to your liking and translated into every language!
* **Multiplier variation** - You can make your boosters simply 'double' experience, but what about insane rates? Go for a booster that multiplies global experience by a 100!
* **Stackable multipliers** - You can make boosters stackable, which means that when two players activate a 2x minecraft booster, the boosters will turn into a 4x multiplier!
* **Bossbars, Holograms** - Notify players about active boosters on the bossbars, and let them know how much experience was dropped when a mob is killed via holograms!

# Dependencies
